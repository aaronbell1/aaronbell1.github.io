      <description>Aaron Bell, Web Developer based in Leicester, UK.   As a developer the landscape of technology is always changing, and I relish the challenge of staying up-to-date with and learning new things in order to stay relevant.  Above all, after being in the industry for a few years now, I have come to learn that my main passion lies in writing clean, reusable and maintainable code using the many useful tools I have at my fingertips.</description>
